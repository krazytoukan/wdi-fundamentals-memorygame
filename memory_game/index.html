		<p id="instructions">Concentration, also known as Match Match, Memory, Pelmanism, Shinkei-suijaku, Pexeso or simply Pairs, is a card game in which all of the cards are laid face down on a surface and two cards are flipped face up over each turn. The object of the game is to turn over pairs of matching cards.</p>

		<p id="history"> For eons, mankind has sought relief from everyday drudgery through games to tantalize and tickle the very folds of our brains.  Concentration is steeped in such history and arose independently and separately in cultures the world over.  From the lowliest peasant to the mightiest Pharoah, Concentration can be played by any and all comers.  So take your shot at the king of games! </p>
